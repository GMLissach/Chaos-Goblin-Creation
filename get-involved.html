        <h2>Become a Chaos Goblin Illustrator</h2>
        <p>Weâ€™re looking for <strong>30 people</strong>, aged <strong>9 to 100</strong>, to help bring this story to life. If chosen, youâ€™ll be sent a scene to illustrate as part of a creative, collaborative art project.</p>
        <p>Before that, weâ€™d love to get to know you through your words and your art.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="services">
    
<h3>Stuff...</h3>
        
        <p>We would <strong>like</strong> you to include a drawing that represents your neurodivergence and whatever that means to you. 
        <p>You donâ€™t have to be diagnosed.</p>
        <p>You donâ€™t have to explain it, but you can.</p> 
        <p>It can be abstract, silly, serious, chaotic, or calm. Itâ€™s up to you.</p>
        <p>Weâ€™d love to see how it manifests in your artwork or what it represents.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;"> Under 18?</h3>
        <p>If youâ€™re under 18, weâ€™ll need a signed permission form from a parent or carer <strong>before</strong> anything you create is shown online with your name, nickname, pseudonym ðŸ‘ˆ (really hate spelling that word). We'll send that over if you're selected.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;"> If Youâ€™re Chosen</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Youâ€™ll be assigned one random scene from the story to illustrate</li>
          <li>Weâ€™ll send clear info about deadlines, format, and credits and I dunno...some random other stuff...?</li>
          <li>Your work will appear on our website (with permission)</li>
        </ul>

 <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">Digital art is welcome.</h3>
<p>This project is all about human creativity -  mistakes, textures, scribbles, and sparks. 
We would rather not have art made with AI or generators.  
<p>There was going to be a full-on *NO THANKS*, but...</p>  
<a href="but-only-if.html">Keith explains the whole AI thing here.</a></p>

<h4 style="margin-top:2rem;">ðŸ“¨ Ready?</h4>
<h2>How to Apply</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce yourself. Your name, nickname, or pseudonym, your age, and one line about why you're interested.</li>
  <li>Attach a sample of your art. It can be anything youâ€™ve drawn. (Nothing rude or gross, please. Thanks, Keith)</li>
</ul>

<p>Send your message to: <strong>chaosgoblincreation@gmail.com</strong></p>
<p>(Nope, it doesnâ€™t link to anything. You have to copy and paste it. Weâ€™re old-fashioned, <s>donâ€™t know what weâ€™re doing</s>, and a bit busy. Thanks, Keith.)</p>
