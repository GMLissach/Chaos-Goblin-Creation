        <h2>Can this go somewhere?</h2>
        <p>Actually, yes. If enough brilliant people take part and it all comes together, the plan is to turn the finished Chaos Goblin story + artwork into a physical or digital publication. Something real. Something weird. Something you could actually hold, gift, regift or sign a copy and leave it on the bus.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="services">
        <h2>What happens if it gets published?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Contributors will be fully credited (unless they request otherwise)</li>
          <li>✅ Any profit will be cover production costs, pay Keith a bit and give some to charity. Because we are nice people.</li>
          <li>✅ Who? I dunno, I just work here. Thanks Keith. 
<p>But, likely something ND-positive, mental health, or youth creative support.</p> 
<p>YOU make a suggestion then! Thanks, Keith.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">I’m not saying we’ll get rich. I’m saying it might make some dosh, and if it does. Marvellous.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="services">
        <h2>But is this a business?</h2>
        <p>Nope lol. This isn’t a startup. There’s no crowdfunding (yet). No sweaty pitching to a load of weirdos in suits. It’s just a story, or a strange little success.</p>
        <p>If it never makes a penny? That’s still fine. You still get to be part of something creative.</p>
      </section>
<section class="services">
  <h2>Know a Worthy Cause?</h2>
  <p>If there’s a charity you love, something that’s helped you or someone you care about then tell us about it. Big or small, weirdly specific or beautifully broad. We want to hear it.</p>
  <p>Email us at <strong>chaosgoblincreation@gmail.com</strong> with the subject line: <em>“Charity Suggestion”</em>. We can’t promise every one will make the shortlist, but we’ll read them all. And if this project does make any dosh, some of it’s going somewhere meaningful. We'll work that bit out if we ever get there, yeah?</p>
  <p>Bonus points if it involves neurodivergent support, creativity, or underdog energy. But we’re open.</p>
