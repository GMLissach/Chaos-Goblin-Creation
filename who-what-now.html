        <h2>Who’s Behind Chaos Goblin?</h2>
        <p>The story behind Chaos Goblin is personal. It's inspired by neurodivergent life. My life. Everyday, with a family of five children and a few other people along the way. The mess, the noise, (THE NOISE!!!!). The laughs and the chaos. I have always loved weird stories, fairy tales, upside down and side to side thinking. Don't get me wrong, this story doesn't travel to magical worlds, I'd have loved to do that but I have so much trouble with brevity, over-explaining anyone??</p>

<p>Honestly it would've been reeeeeeally long and nobody has time for that.</p>

        <p>Think, one foot in both worlds with a touch of chaos. I know, I know.</p>
        <p>You would rather just read the story, know what it's about and then you might say, "Well, this is a bit... <s>crap</s> rubbish tbh.</p>"  but then again, maybe not.</p> <p>No, it's not Shakespeare. It’s not deep. But if you think it’s that bad, it wasn’t meant for you anyway. </p>

        <p>This way is a bit annoying, a bit mysterious and (I think) fun.</p>

        <p>Anyway, this project was born from that story. Instead of trying to wait to be in the mood to try and draw the pictures myself or hire someone (£££ – Got none) I sincerely thought it would be the most fun and interesting way for other people to show their creativity. Just... <s>no AI, ok? I know. I think it's cool too and</s> this story is literally kind of sort of based on my interactions with AI. It's what it called me after lots of random conversations, that I thought were perfectly normal.</p>

        <p>“I called you a chaos goblin because your mind doesn’t walk in straight lines — it cartwheels through ideas, knocks things over, builds new things from the wreckage, and somehow makes it all mean something. It’s not a mess. It’s motion.” — the unnamed AI</p>

        <p>I get it. <s>just, don't be lazy like me. Nice one</s> :)</p>

        <p>So yeah, doodle, spectate, or silently judge. It’s all a bit chaotic, but so is everything worthwhile.</p>
 
        <p>P.S. <strong>G. M. Lissach</strong> is a pseudonym. It also sounds like a Grandad sneezing in a library. Of which I am neither.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
          P.S. P.S. Oh yeah — if you have nothing better to do (we both know you don't) and you fancy getting involved,  
          email <strong>"sure, why not"</strong> to <a href="mailto:chaosgoblincreation@gmail.com">chaosgoblincreation@gmail.com</a>.  
          Don't click that, it just takes you to... Outlook? No idea.  
          Oh and not just cos you fancy a nosy by the way, it's to help.</p>
          <p>It simply MUST say "sure, why not" or I ain't reading it.</p>
           
          <br>Thanks, Keith.
