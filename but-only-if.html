        <h2>AI Art, Existential Crises & Whatever This Is</h2>
        <p>Hi. It’s me. More typing. Yay.</p>

<p>So apparently excluding AI-generated images is now considered “a bit dusty”  which I assume means:</p>
<p>outdated, unfair, and possibly an affront to progress and creativity and… whatever.</p>

<p>I was told all this during a very long speech about how not everyone can express themselves through drawing, and how some people think in words, not pictures, and how AI has been really important in helping them organise their thoughts and feel seen and… look, I stopped listening, okay?</p> 
<p>I was eating.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s the gist:</p>

<p>So Can I Submit AI-Generated Art or not?</p>
<p>Yes. You can.</p>
If AI helps you express your brain better than anything else, then yeah, submit it.

<p>Try to use it in the most creative way possible.</p>
Tell us who made it, how you made it, and why you picked that method.
<p>Just so we know it’s genuinely yours and not stolen from a stock image site.</p>
<p>But Should I?</p>
Ideally? Try not to.
<p>But if you have to, if it’s your voice, your idea, your thingy and won't get anyone sued. That's fine</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
Yes, you can submit AI images but only if you

really try to be original and intentional.

Let us know who/what made it (you + AI, tool used, prompt maybe?)

Don’t submit anything you don’t own.

Try not to overthink it. The author already has.

Okay? Yeah?
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

Thanks, Keith
